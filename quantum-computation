        Quantum Computing is pretty much using the amazing and powerful laws of <b><em>quantum mechanics</em></b> to process information
        in a computing machine. A normal computer like the one that I am using to create this webpage uses long strings
        called <em><b>bits</b></em> which hold the values of either zero or one. These bits are used for only the <b><em>processor</em></b>
        because only the processor understands that language. A quantum computer however, uses <b>quantum bits</b> or a short term
        for that would be called <b><em>qubits</em></b>. We will get more to that later though...

        Technology has certainly evoloved from time to time considering the fact that now we have such tiny microprocessors to be able
        and process information really fast and the fact that back then 200MB would have been huge but now it's really nothing much.
        We have literally come from gears to transistors to integrated circuits and now we are advancing to bigger more complex machines
        that are capable of doing awesome and amazing things. With how all the technology are becoming nano-sized, we are seeing the fact that
        chips and processors are being smaller and smaller and when that happens then the logic gates become to a point where they would have an atomic
        size.

        A <em><b>bit</b></em> is a physical system that can be prepared in one of two different states representing two
        logical values: <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>, <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>, or even <b>0</b> and <b>1</b>. Qubits are implemented using
        quantum mechanical two state systems and they are not confined to their two basic states but can also exist in <b><em>superpositions</em></b>.
        <b>What this means is that the qubit is both in state 0 and state 1.</b> Any classical register composed of three bits can store in
        a given moment of time only one out of eight different numbers. A quantum register composed of three qubits can store in a given moment
        of time all eight numbers in a quantum superposition. The register can perform operations on all of the different numbers once the register
        is prepared in superposition. Therefore the quantum computers can perform many different calculations in parallel. <b>This means
        that a system is N qubits can perform 2 to the power of n.</b> For information on <b>superposition</b>, please click this

        All computers in general process certain information using methods that it was programmed to use and they are called <b><em>algorithms</em></b>.
        For more information on algorithms, please click this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">link</a>. For an algorithm to
        be efficient, the time the algorithm needs for it to be executed must increase no faster than a polynomial function regarding the size of its
        input. We need to think about the input size as the total number of bits needed to specify the input to the problem. For example, the number
        of bits needed to encode the number we want to <b>factorize</b>. If we use the best algorithm we know for a particular problem has
        the execution time bounded by a polynomial, then we say that the problem belongs to a class P. Problems that are outside the class P are
        known as "hard problems" and that means that it is either impossible to solve or non-computable. However, there are <b><em>quantum algorithms</em></b>
        that do turn hard mathematical problems into easy ones.

        </h2>
      <p>
        As a fundamental truth, to actually build a quantum computer, we need to start with some simple <b>quantum logic gates</b> and
        connect them up with the quantum networks. A <b>quantum logic gate</b> like a normal logic gate is a very simple computing
        device that performs one elementary quantum operation, usually on two qubits in a given time. Quantum logic however, differs from
        the classical counterparts in that they can create and perform operations on <b>quantum superpositions</b>. As the number of quantum
        gates in the network increases, we start to run into some serious problems. The more interacting qubits that are involved will start
        to increase the difficulty for engineering the interaction that would display the quantum properties. The more components there are, the
        more likely it is that quantum information will spread outside the quantum computer and be lost in the environment, thus messing up the
        computation. This is known as <b><em>decoherence</em></b>. The task that needs to be accomplished is to engineer sub-microscopic systems
        in which qubits <b>affect eachother</b> but not the <b>environment</b>.

      <p>
        Right now, we do have actual quantum computers but not sufficient or powerful enough to replace our classical computers.
        A team of researchers from the <b>IQC(Institute for Quantum Computing)</b> and <b>MIT(Massachusetts Institute of Technology)</b>
        hold the world record for using the most number of qubits in an experiment and the number is 12. Practical quantum technologies
        are right now emerging such as highly effective sensors and actuators. Unfortunately as of now, a powerful quantum computer that can
        outperform a classical computer is still years away and theorists are figuring out ways of trying to avoid <b>decoherence</b>. Experimentalists
        are gaining more control over the quantum world through various technologies and instruments and all of this is paving the way for
        the quantum era and the possibilities that lie ahead are endless.

<!--I just like quantum physics, mechanics and computation, and honestly I just wanted to add
some light on the subject to some people... and no I am not studying to be a physicist but a
computer engineer and I believe that quantum computers will be and shape our future -->
